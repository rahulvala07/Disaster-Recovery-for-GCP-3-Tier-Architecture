## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Prerequisites

- GCP Account with billing enabled
- Basic understanding of GCP services and networking concepts
- Terraform installed (version >= 1.0)
- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI) installed and configured
- Git for version control

### Setup

**1. Initialize GCP Project:** Create new GCP project, enable billing, and authenticate using gcloud CLI with application default credentials. Configure project quotas ensuring at least 8 compute instances and required API access.

**2. Enable Required APIs:** Activate Compute Engine API, Cloud SQL Admin API, Cloud Storage API, Service Networking API, Cloud Monitoring API, and Cloud Logging API. Wait 3-5 minutes for API propagation across GCP infrastructure.

**3. Create VPC Networks:** Set up primary VPC in Mumbai region with CIDR 10.0.0.0/8 and secondary VPC in Delhi region with peering configuration. Create four subnets total - two for web tier and two for application tier across both regions.

**4. Configure VPC Peering:** Establish bidirectional VPC peering between Mumbai and Delhi networks enabling private cross-region communication. Configure auto-create routes for seamless connectivity between all subnets.

**5. Set Up Firewall Rules:** Define eight firewall rules controlling traffic flow - allow HTTP/HTTPS from internet to web tier, enable internal communication within VPC ranges, permit SSH via Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP), and allow health check probes from Google Cloud load balancers.

**6. Configure Cloud Storage:** Create three GCS buckets with versioning enabled - primary storage bucket in Mumbai, secondary storage bucket in Delhi for disaster recovery, and terraform state bucket with encryption and lifecycle policies.

**7. Set Up Private Service Networking:** Allocate IP ranges for private service connection and establish service networking connection for Cloud SQL instances to communicate securely within VPC without public IP exposure.

**8. Deploy Cloud SQL Primary Database:** Launch Cloud SQL MySQL 8.0 instance in Mumbai region with private IP configuration, automated backups scheduled at 3 AM, binary logging enabled for replication, and point-in-time recovery for disaster scenarios.

**9. Configure Cross-Region Replica:** Create read replica in Delhi region connected to primary database via internal VPC peering, enabling real-time replication with sub-30-second lag for disaster recovery and read scaling.

**10. Deploy Compute Instance Templates:** Create four instance templates defining web and application tier configurations including machine types, boot disk images, startup scripts for automated configuration, and metadata for database connectivity.

**11. Set Up Managed Instance Groups:** Deploy regional instance groups in both Mumbai and Delhi with auto-healing policies, health checks monitoring application availability, and base instance counts (2 primary, 1 secondary for warm standby).

**12. Configure Auto Scaling:** Implement auto-scaling policies based on CPU utilization targeting 70% threshold, scaling from 2-10 instances in primary region and 1-6 instances in secondary region with 60-second cooldown periods.

**13. Deploy Global Load Balancer:** Configure external HTTP(S) load balancer with backend services in both regions, URL maps for traffic routing, health checks ensuring instance availability, and global IP address for unified entry point.

**14. Implement Cloud Armor (Paid Tier):** Deploy Cloud Armor security policies protecting against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, local file inclusion, and remote code execution attacks. Configure rate limiting preventing DDoS attacks and geographic blocking for threat mitigation.

**15. Set Up Cloud Monitoring:** Create monitoring workspace, configure uptime checks pinging application every 5 minutes, establish alert policies for database downtime and high CPU usage, and configure email notification channels.

**16. Configure Logging and Alerting:** Enable Cloud Logging for all resources capturing access logs, error logs, and system logs. Set up log sinks forwarding critical events to BigQuery for analysis and alerting on anomalous patterns.

**17. Validate Disaster Recovery:** Test failover by scaling down primary region instances to zero, verify traffic automatically routes to secondary region, confirm database replica serves read queries, and validate RTO under 5 minutes.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This multi-region disaster recovery architecture provides production-ready infrastructure capable of handling mission-critical workloads while maintaining high availability and data durability across geographic regions. The implementation demonstrates Google Cloud Platform's comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities and adherence to cloud architecture best practices.

### The architecture achieves:

**Reliability:** Multi-region deployment with automatic failover ensuring 99.95% availability and business continuity during regional outages. Cross-region database replication maintains data consistency with sub-30-second recovery point objective.

**Performance:** Global HTTP(S) load balancing distributes traffic intelligently across healthy backends. Auto-scaling responds dynamically to demand spikes, maintaining sub-150ms API latency at 95th percentile while optimizing resource utilization.

**Security:** Private VPC networks isolate workloads with firewall rules enforcing least-privilege access. Cloud Armor WAF protects against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including SQL injection and XSS attacks. Identity-Aware Proxy secures administrative access without exposing SSH ports.

**Cost Optimization:** Warm standby approach runs minimal resources in secondary region until needed. Auto-scaling eliminates over-provisioning by matching capacity to demand. Committed use discounts and sustained use discounts reduce compute costs by up to 57%.

**Operational Excellence:** Infrastructure as Code using Terraform enables version-controlled, repeatable deployments. Cloud Monitoring provides comprehensive observability with automated alerting. Centralized logging facilitates troubleshooting and audit compliance.

**Disaster Recovery Capability:** Achieves 2-5 minute Recovery Time Objective and sub-30-second Recovery Point Objective through automated failover mechanisms. Database replication ensures zero data loss during regional failures with automatic promotion capabilities.

### Use Cases

This architecture demonstrates enterprise-grade cloud resilience suitable for:

- **E-commerce platforms** requiring 24/7 availability during peak shopping seasons with zero-downtime deployments
- **Financial services** needing geographic redundancy for regulatory compliance and data sovereignty requirements  
- **SaaS applications** serving global customers demanding low latency and high availability across regions
- **Healthcare systems** processing sensitive patient data requiring HIPAA compliance and disaster recovery
- **Media streaming** platforms handling variable traffic patterns with automatic scaling during viral content events

With comprehensive encryption, automated threat detection, continuous monitoring, and tested disaster recovery procedures, this architecture provides the foundation for building resilient cloud-native applications that meet stringent enterprise requirements for availability, security, and compliance.
